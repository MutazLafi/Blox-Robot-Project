<h1> Readme File For BloxRobot</h1>
<h3>Hello to The Blox Robot README File </h3>

<h1>About The Robot</h1>
<p>Hello Thanks For Visiting My Project,
This Robot Is Controlled By Arduino Mega 2560 All The details about it in the about Mikrocontroller page
first off all the Idea Of This Robot is first:
Select the Mode You want from the Control Panel in The Robot
There is 2 modes:
Explorer Mode 
Sensors And Bluetooth Mode 

Second Thing:
Choose The Speed From The potentiometer in The Control Panel
Then Put You MicroSD Card In The Adapter in The Control Panel
Note: The Control Panel is A Small Breadbooard In the Right Of The Robot

Batterys:

The Batterys Is Li-on 18650 3.7 volt 
We Have 3 Of Them In The Robot 
with battery holder.
</p>


<h1>Requirments To Build It </h1>
<p>All The Requirments Of The Robot You can Find it in The File Requirements.txt https://github.com/MutazLafi/Blox-Robot-Project/blob/master/Requirments.txt 
You Can Find These Parts In MikroElectron in Jordan
</p>

<h1>The Shape Of The Robot </h1>
<p>
The Robot mode By A chase its  Shape Is like A car 
You can Know The Shape Of The Robot in the Images In The File Images_for_Robot
</p>

<h1>ExplorerMode</h1>
<p>
The Robot will Move Until it See A object Then Will Stop And See The Distance And Objects in The Right And Left
Then Calculate What is The Best Way Lets Say that Right Is The Best Way(The Distance of It longer Than Left So No objects In The Right) Then Go Right And ALL This In a Loop
</p>

<h1>Bluetooth And Sensors Mode</h1>
<p>
This Mode Contain 3 modules 
Bluetooth 
IR
Sound
first Of All Bluetooth :
It will Get Bluetooth data From A device Like The Phone And Go Like The Data
IR:
If You Put Your Hand In Behind The Ir Sensor The Robot Will Move Randomly for a second.
Sound:
if You Clap Or Making Sound In Any way The Robot Will Move Randomly For A second.
</p>

<h1>GPS Module And Logging</h1>
<p>
in Every Move In The Robot The Robot Will Log The Gps Data To the Micro SD Card
As A Link To Google Maps via the GPS Module Ublox 6 Neom GPS Module
with Antenna
Not Only GPS The Robot Will Log Every Thing will Happen Like Moving or Starting the Robot To The MicroSd Card
</p>

<h1>About MikroCntroller Mega 2560</h1>
<p>
The MikroController Of The Project is Arduino Mega 2560
it Have The Atmel Chip
With 53 Digittal Pins 13 of Thim pwm 8 of them for comunection
and 16 AnalogPins 
</p>
<h1>Maker And Coder</h1>
<p>
The Maker And Coder of this Robot:
Mutaz Lafi
I Live In jordan And Im from There
I Have Worked on Robots And Projects before This Robot

</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
Thanks for Reading About The Project I hope You Enjoyed Reading About The Robot 
And If You Can Make This Robot And Using the code and images I will Be Very Thankfull.
